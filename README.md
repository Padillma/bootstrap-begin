## Objective
This project was created for me to learn and potentially master BootStrap. I am planning to use BootStrap on most of my future projects. I wanted to polish my HTML and CSS fundamentals as well.
I had help from videos, websites and referred to the BootStrap Docs as this was my first time using it. Now, I have a great grasp on how to ues its components and modify it to best suit my needs for my projects. 

## Description
This webpage is based off a book on web development and its focused is to sell its ebook version. The webpage was going to have a nav section, main section to give a brief introduction with an image of the real hard copy of the book, a shop section displaying the 2 other versions with price and buttons, 
a section to futher showcase the book with its chapters topic and a little in-depth information, a book review section, a form for questions of the customer, a registration section for updates. Sadly, as I wanted to focus more learning Bootsrap, I did not implement functionality to the buttons on the webpage.
